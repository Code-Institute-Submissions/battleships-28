                <li>
                    At the start of the game, each user will place their ships on coordinates of their own choosing. Drag a ship and drop it to place it on your chosen coordinates. There are a total of 100 coordinates/spaces on each user's game board, and each ship can take up anywhere from 2-5 coordinates/spaces on the board.
                </li>
                <li>
                    During each turn, the user will decide on coordinates to attack. You can simply click on the coordinates you would like to attack or type them into the hitbox.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the attacked coordinates are empty, the turn is labelled as a "miss". However, if the coordinates are holding a section of your opponent's ship, the turn is labelled as a "hit" and the ship will take damage in that specific coordinate. Of course, the same applies to you during your opponents turn.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If all coordinates which house a ship are attacked, that ship is considered to be sunk, and is no longer active in the game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You also have access to a "hit board" which can be accessed by the button on your action bar. This board labels all coordinates that you have attacked and whether they were a "hit" or a "miss".
                </li>
                <li>
                    The first person to successfully sink all of their opponents ships is the winner!
