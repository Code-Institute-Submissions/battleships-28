                    At the start of the game, each user will place their ships on coordinates of their own choosing. Drag a ship and drop it to place it on your chosen coordinates. There are a total of 100 coordinates/spaces on each user's game board, and each ship can take up anywhere from 2-5 coordinates/spaces on the board.<b>Right click on a ship to rotate it</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    During each turn, the user will decide on coordinates to attack. You can simply type them into the hitbox.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the attacked coordinates are empty, the turn is labelled as a "miss". However, if the coordinates are holding a section of your opponent's ship, the turn is labelled as a "hit" and the ship will take damage in that specific coordinate. Of course, the same applies to you during your opponents turn. You will score points based on ship hits. You will gain extra points for hitting ships consecutively and for sinking ships.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If all coordinates which house a ship are attacked, that ship is considered to be sunk, and is no longer active in the game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The first person to successfully sink all of their opponents ships is the winner!
